# Clima
Clima is a iOS weather app. It will provide weather info based on your current location or the location you put in. 

In this app, I practiced the concepts:
* Accessing and using Geolocation
* Alamofire library imported via Cocoapods
* Codable functionality in Swift 4
* Passing data back to a previous ViewController using protocols and delegates
* Working with closures
* Using the model, view, controller paradigm
* Accessing an API with the help of its own documentation
